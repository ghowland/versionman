## VersionMan

VersionMan is a database versioning API, so that you can maintain logs of changes and doing roll-backs and other good vesioning stuff like that.

MySQL is currently the only implemented backend DB, but it was designed to add more as I need them.

This system should be considered an "as is" release, I'm not ready to start supporting it as open source yet, so use at your own risk or fork.  This may change in the future as I divert my attention back to it.
